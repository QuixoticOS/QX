#Cloning The Repo 

1.Start by creating a fork of the Repository : https://github.com/QuixoticOS/QX

2. After you create a fork, download your local copy, work on your copy, once your work is ready, go to github and create a pull request. 	

#Setting up your local  Server: 
In order to minimize complexity at this stage, we are going to be setting up a simple http-server ( hold your horses, we can complicate things later, trust me)

1. Make sure node & npm are installed on your system.
3. With npm use the following command to install  HTTP-server:
3. npm install http-server -g 
4. To run the server cd into the directory where the index.html file is located.
5. Run: http-server -c-1 -p 61116 
 	the syntax works as following: http-server -c-1[sets the cache to -1] -p [port number]
6. Feel free to choose whichever port number you like for now.

#Workflow 

1.Before you start working on anything, make sure to make pull request so you have the most updated version of the project. 

2.Make sure to push the changes every day you work on the project, that way if you're not able to work on it the next day, someone else can.
